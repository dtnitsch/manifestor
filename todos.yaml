    description: "Must-have for next release; unlocks real reasoning value"
    items:
      - id: rollup-size-stats
        title: "Directory size statistics"
        status: complete
        details:
          - total_size_bytes
          - min_file_size
          - max_file_size
          - mean_file_size
          - median_file_size
        rationale: "Enables cost estimation, monster file detection, ingestion safety"

      - id: rollup-size-buckets
        title: "File size buckets"
        status: planned
        details:
          - "<1KB"
          - "1KB-1MB"
          - "1MB-10MB"
          - ">10MB"
        rationale: "Fast binary/blob detection without rescanning"

      - id: rollup-activity-span
        title: "Modification time span"
        status: planned
        details:
          - oldest_mtime
          - newest_mtime
          - span_seconds
        rationale: "Identifies active vs dead directories"

      - id: capability-integrity
        title: "Capability-driven invariant enforcement"
        status: in-progress
        details:
          - manifest-declared capabilities
          - table-driven validation
          - per-capability failure reporting
        rationale: "Prevents silent data corruption and enables safe downstream reasoning"

      - id: rollup-completeness
        title: "Rollup completeness indicators"
        status: planned
        details:
          - directories_with_rollups
          - directories_missing_rollups
        rationale: "Allows consumers to reason about partial manifests"

  p1:
    description: "High signal, low additional cost"
    items:
      - id: extension-entropy
        title: "Extension entropy metric"
        status: planned
        rationale: "Detects mixed-modality directories and summarization complexity"

      - id: structure-depth
        title: "Directory depth metrics"
        status: planned
        details:
          - max_depth
          - avg_depth
        rationale: "Distinguishes wide vs deep trees for chunking strategies"

      - id: schema-evolution-policy
        title: "Schema and capability evolution rules"
        status: planned
        rationale: "Ensures backward compatibility and safe consumer upgrades"

  p2:
    description: "Nice to have; supports smarter routing later"
    items:
      - id: text-binary-ratio
        title: "Text vs binary file counts"
        status: will-not-do
        rationale: "Prevents wasted LLM tokens; improves ingestion decisions"

      - id: largest-files
        title: "Top-N largest files"
        status: planned
        details:
          - limit: 3
        rationale: "Explains skewed stats and aids human debugging"

  p3:
    description: "Deferred / future"
    items:
      - id: hotspot-score
        title: "Heuristic hotspot score"
        status: deferred
        rationale: "Useful for UI and triage but requires tuning"

notes:
  - "All rollup metrics must be derivable in a single scan pass"
  - "No file content reads beyond stat() in v0.2"
  - "Rollup must remain cheap enough to run on large repos"
